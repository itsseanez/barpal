# About
BarPal is a cloud-ready bar inventory management application designed to help bars track liquor stock, log usage, and identify inventory variance. Instead of relying on manual counts and guesswork, BarPal provides a structured, auditable system that mirrors real bar operations.

The app focuses on inventory accuracy and accountability, allowing managers to understand where product is going and bartenders to log pours without direct inventory manipulation. BarPal is intentionally scoped as an operational tool rather than a full POS system.

### Problem:
Bars lose significant revenue due to:

- Inaccurate inventory counts

- Over-pouring and untracked usage

- Lack of audit history

- Manual, error-prone tracking methods

Most POS systems focus on sales, not operational inventory integrity. BarPal addresses this gap.

### Solution:
BarPal provides:

- Role-based access for managers and bartenders

  - Managers: manage inventory, view variance

  - Bartenders: log pours only

- Structured inventory tracking by volume

- Usage logging that automatically updates stock levels

- Variance calculations to highlight discrepancies

- A simple dashboard for operational visibility
- Inventory overview at a glance
